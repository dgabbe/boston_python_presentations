```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Defining 'dunder':

- BNF notation: '\_\_'lowercase-alphachars'\_\_'
- Part of Python's internal machinery
- Invisible
- Exposed to make Python programming easier
	
## Example 1: Shell Scripting

```{python example-1, eval=FALSE}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
else:
    print("    ** Did not plan on being imported **", file=stderr)
```
> - Python needs to know which function to call first if there are multiple functions in a file.

> - `__name__`: Built-in variable that evaluates to the name of the current module.

> - `__main__`: The name of a module when it's read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.

> - Main is the unindented level of code

## Example 2: Iteration

```{python iterables, eval=TRUE}
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
for f in fruits:
    print(f)

```

Why is it so wonderful & why does this work?

## A Lesson from C

```
for ( i=0; i<len(fruits); i++ ) {
   print(fruit[i]);
}
```

Compared to 

```{python, eval=FALSE}
for f in fruits:
    print(f)
```

## Iteration con't

- Able to print out the fruits list because Python gave us for free a mechanism for iteration over a list.

> - Python objects have attributes
> - The attribute that makes an object iterable is '\_\_iter\_\_'

## Invisible Dunder World Tour {.build}

- What is `fruits`?

```{python}
type(fruits)
```

- Does it have the `__iter__` attribute?
```{python}
hasattr(fruits, '__iter__')
```

## Tour (con't) {.build}

- How many attributes does it have?
```{python}
len(dir(fruits))
```

## Tour (con't, 2) {.build}

- What are all of `fruits` attributes?
```{python}
from textwrap import fill
print(fill(repr(dir(fruits)), width=70))
```

## Dunders to add

__doc__,  __repr__,  __str__, __builtins__, mutables
